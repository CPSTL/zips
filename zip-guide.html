            <h2>Don't Panic</h2>
            <p>If this is your first time writing a ZIP, the structure and format may look intimidating. But really, it's just meant to reflect common-sense practice and some technical conventions. Feel free to start with a simple initial draft that gets ideas across, even if it doesn't quite follow this format. The community and ZIP editors will help you figure things out and get it into shape later.</p>

        <section id="terminology">
            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p>{Edit this to reflect the key words that are actually used.} The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. <a id="id1" class="footnote_reference" href="#rfc2119">1</a></p>
            <p>The terms below are to be interpreted as follows:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>{Term to be defined}</dt>
                <dd>{Definition.}</dd>
                <dt>{Another term}</dt>
                <dd>{Definition.}</dd>
            </dl>
        </section>
        <section id="abstract">
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>{Describe what this proposal does, typically in a few paragraphs.</p>
            <p>The Abstract should only provide a summary of the ZIP; the ZIP should remain complete without the Abstract.</p>
            <p>Use links where applicable, e.g. <a id="id2" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol">2</a>.}</p>
        </section>
        <section id="motivation">
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>{Why is this proposal needed?</p>
            <p>This is one of the most important sections of the ZIP, and should be detailed and comprehensive. It shouldn't include any of the actual specification -- don't put conformance requirements in this section.</p>
            <p>Explain the status quo, why the status quo is in need of improvement, and if applicable, the history of how this area has changed. Then describe <em>at a high level</em> why this proposed solution addresses the perceived issues. It is ok if this is somewhat redundant with the abstract, but here you can go into a lot more detail.}</p>
        </section>
        <section id="requirements">
            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>{Describe design constraints on, or goals for the solution -- typically one paragraph for each constraint or goal. Again, don't actually specify anything here; this section is primarily for use as a consistency check that what is specified meets the requirements.}</p>
        </section>
        <section id="non-requirements">
            <h2>Non-requirements</h2>
            <p>{This section is entirely optional. If it is present, it describes issues that the proposal is <em>not</em> attempting to address, that someone might otherwise think it does or should.}</p>
        </section>
        <section id="specification">
            <h2>Specification</h2>
            <p>{This section describes what should change, using precise language and conformance key words. Anything that is <em>required in order to implement the ZIP</em> (or follow its process, in the case of a Process ZIP) should be in this section.</p>
            <p>Avoid overspecification! Also avoid underspecification. Specification is hard. Don't be afraid to ask for help.</p>
            <p>Unless the specification is particularly simple, you will need to organise it under subheadings.}</p>
            <section id="example-subheading">
                <h3>Example subheading</h3>
                <p>{At least while the ZIP is in Draft, we encourage writing open questions and TODOs.}</p>
                <section id="open-questions">
                    <h4>Open questions</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What happens if a full node can't parse the fandangle as a doohicky?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>TODO: define byte encoding for the Jabberwock.</p>
                    <p>{Feel free to copy from other ZIPs doing similar things, e.g. defining RPC calls, consensus rules, etc.}</p>

            <section id="valid-restructuredtext">
                <h3>Valid reStructuredText</h3>
                <p>This is optional before publishing a PR, but to check whether a document is valid reStructuredText, first install rst2html5:</p>
                <pre>sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install rst2html5</pre>
                <p>Then, with <code>zip-xxxx.rst</code> in the root directory of a clone of this repo, run:</p>
                <pre>make zip-xxxx.html</pre>
                <p>and view <code>zip-xxxx.html</code> in a web browser.</p>
