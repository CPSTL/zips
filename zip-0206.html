            <section id="blossom-deployment">
                <h3>Blossom deployment</h3>
                <p>The primary sources of information about Blossom consensus protocol changes are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Zcash Protocol Specification <a id="id5" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol">1</a>.</li>
                    <li>Shorter Block Target Spacing <a id="id6" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0208">5</a>.</li>
                    <li>Network Upgrade Activation Mechanism <a id="id7" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0200">3</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The network handshake and peer management mechanisms defined in <a id="id8" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0201">4</a> also apply to this upgrade.</p>
                <p>The following network upgrade constants <a id="id9" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0200">3</a> are defined for the Blossom upgrade:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>BRANCH_ID</dt>
                    <dd><code>0x2BB40E60</code></dd>
                    <dt>ACTIVATION_HEIGHT (Blossom)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>Testnet: 584000</p>
                        <p>Mainnet: 653600</p>
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <p>Nodes compatible with Blossom activation on testnet MUST advertise protocol version 170008 or later. Nodes compatible with Blossom activation on mainnet MUST advertise protocol version 170009 or later. The minimum peer protocol version that Blossom-compatible nodes will connect to will be 170007.</p>
                <p>Pre-Blossom testnet nodes are defined as nodes on testnet advertising a protocol version less than 170008. Pre-Blossom mainnet nodes are defined as nodes on mainnet advertising a protocol version less than 170009.</p>
                <p>For each network (testnet and mainnet), approximately three days (defined in terms of block height) before the corresponding Blossom activation height, nodes compatible with Blossom activation on that network will change the behaviour of their peer connection logic in order to prefer pre-Blossom peers on that network for eviction from the set of peer connections:</p>
                <pre>/** The period before a network upgrade activates, where connections to upgrading peers are preferred (in blocks). */
static const int NETWORK_UPGRADE_PEER_PREFERENCE_BLOCK_PERIOD = 24 * 24 * 3;</pre>
                <p>The implementation is similar to that for Overwinter which was described in <a id="id10" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0201">4</a>.</p>
                <p>Once Blossom activates on testnet or mainnet, Blossom nodes should take steps to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>reject new connections from pre-Blossom nodes on that network;</li>
                    <li>disconnect any existing connections to pre-Blossom nodes on that network.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
        </section>
        <section id="backward-compatibility">
            <h2>Backward compatibility</h2>
            <p>Prior to the network upgrade activating on each network, Blossom and pre-Blossom nodes are compatible and can connect to each other. However, Blossom nodes will have a preference for connecting to other Blossom nodes, so pre-Blossom nodes will gradually be disconnected in the run up to activation.</p>
            <p>Once the network upgrades, even though pre-Blossom nodes can still accept the numerically larger protocol version used by Blossom as being valid, Blossom nodes will always disconnect peers using lower protocol versions.</p>
            <p>Unlike Overwinter and Sapling, Blossom does not define a new transaction version. Blossom transactions are therefore in the same v4 format as Sapling transactions, and use the same version group ID, i.e. 0x892F2085 as defined in <a id="id11" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol">1</a> section 7.1. This does not imply that transactions are valid across the Blossom activation, since signatures MUST use the appropriate consensus branch ID.</p>

        <section id="support-in-zcashd">
            <h2>Support in zcashd</h2>
            <p>Support for Blossom on testnet will be implemented in <code>zcashd</code> version 2.0.7, which will advertise protocol version 170008. Support for Blossom on mainnet will be implemented in <code>zcashd</code> version 2.1.0, which will advertise protocol version 170009.</p>
