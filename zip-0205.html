            <p>This proposal defines the deployment of the Sapling network upgrade. In addition, it describes a hard fork that occurred on testnet to allow "minimum-difficulty" blocks.</p>

                <h3>Sapling deployment</h3>
                <p>The primary sources of information about Sapling consensus protocol changes are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Zcash Protocol Specification <a id="id3" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol">1</a>.</li>
                    <li>Transaction Signature Verification for Sapling <a id="id4" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0243">5</a>.</li>
                    <li>Network Upgrade Activation Mechanism <a id="id5" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0200">3</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The network handshake and peer management mechanisms defined in <a id="id6" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0201">4</a> also apply to this upgrade.</p>
                <p>The following network upgrade constants <a id="id7" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0200">3</a> are defined for the Sapling upgrade:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>BRANCH_ID</dt>
                    <dd><code>0x76b809bb</code></dd>
                    <dt>ACTIVATION_HEIGHT (Sapling)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>Testnet: 280000</p>
                        <p>Mainnet: 419200</p>
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <p>On testnet, Sapling had activated prior to this height, but that branch was rolled back. A subsequent hard fork occurred on testnet, changing the difficulty algorithm to accept "minimum-difficulty" blocks under certain conditions starting at block height 299188.</p>
                <p>On both mainnet and testnet, Sapling-compatible nodes MUST advertise protocol version 170007 or later. The minimum peer protocol version that Sapling-compatible nodes will connect to, remains 170002.</p>
                <p>Pre-Sapling nodes are defined as nodes advertising a protocol version less than 170007.</p>
                <p>Approximately three days (defined in terms of block height) before the Sapling activation height, Sapling-compatible nodes will change the behaviour of their peer connection logic in order to prefer pre-Sapling peers for eviction from the set of peer connections.</p>
                <pre>/** The period before a network upgrade activates, where connections to upgrading peers are preferred (in blocks). */
static const int NETWORK_UPGRADE_PEER_PREFERENCE_BLOCK_PERIOD = 24 * 24 * 3;</pre>
                <p>The implementation is similar to that for Overwinter which was described in <a id="id8" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0201">4</a>.</p>
                <p>Once Sapling activates on testnet or mainnet, Sapling nodes should take steps to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>reject new connections from pre-Sapling nodes;</li>
                    <li>disconnect any existing connections to pre-Sapling nodes.</li>
                </ul>

            <section id="change-to-difficulty-adjustment-on-testnet">
                <h3>Change to difficulty adjustment on testnet</h3>
                <p>Section 7.6.3 of <a id="id9" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol">1</a> describes the algorithm used to adjust the difficulty of a block (defined in terms of a "target threshold") based on the <code>nTime</code> and <code>nBits</code> fields of preceding blocks.</p>
                <p>This algorithm changed on testnet, starting from block 299188, to allow "minimum-difficulty" blocks. If the block time of a block from this height onward is at least 15 minutes after that of the preceding block, then the block is a minimum-difficulty block, and its target threshold is set to the value of PoWLimit for testnet (see <a id="id10" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol">1</a> section 5.3). However, its <code>nBits</code> field is still computed according to the original difficulty adjustment algorithm.</p>
                <p>This does not affect how the minimum-difficulty block is treated for subsequent difficulty adjustments. In particular, only the <code>nBits</code> field computed by the original algorithm is used for the purpose of computing the MeanTarget values from which subsequent difficulty changes are calculated.</p>
                <p>This change does not affect mainnet.</p>

        <section id="backward-compatibility">
            <h2>Backward compatibility</h2>
            <p>Prior to the network upgrade activating, Sapling and pre-Sapling nodes are compatible and can connect to each other. However, Sapling nodes will have a preference for connecting to other Sapling nodes, so pre-Sapling nodes will gradually be disconnected in the run up to activation.</p>
            <p>Once the network upgrades, even though pre-Sapling nodes can still accept the numerically larger protocol version used by Sapling as being valid, Sapling nodes will always disconnect peers using lower protocol versions.</p>

        <section id="support-in-zcashd">
            <h2>Support in zcashd</h2>
            <p>Support for Sapling consensus rules was implemented in zcashd version 2.0.0. The majority of support for RPC calls and persistence of Sapling z-addresses was implemented in version 2.0.1. Both of these versions advertise protocol version 170007.</p>
